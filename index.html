  <h1>This is a header. There are 6 sizes. This is #1.</h1>
  <h2>This is #2.</h2>
  <h3>This is #3.</h3>
  <h4>This is #4.</h4>
  <h5>This is #5.</h5>
  <h6>This is #6.</h6>
  <p>This is a paragraph. The paragraph can have a lot of spaces and lot of line breaks in the code but the website will ignore those.
    The number of lines depend on the size of the window. If I want a line break like this <br> I have to use the line break code. </p>
  <p>Links can go in the paragraph too.
  <h3>These are the links to developer websites where codes are documented:</h3>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> <br>
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>

<h2>Sometimes we need lists. There are two kinds:</h2>
<h3>This kind is the unordered list:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is a list item in an unordered list.</li>
  <li>This is another item in an unordered list</li>
</ul>
<h3>This kind is called ordered list.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>This is a list item in an ordered list.</li>
  <li>This one is another item in an ordered list.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tables:</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>This is heading with bolder letters.</th>
      <th>Another heading.</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>This is a table data</td>
    <td>Some more table data</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This is a table data</td>
    <td>Another table data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tfoot>
    <td>something</td>
    <td>this can be the conclusion or the sum of the table.</td>
  </tfoot>
